# virtual_assistant
This project is a basic implementation of a personal voice assistant called SHANK. It can perform simple tasks like fetching information from Wikipedia, opening websites, playing music, telling the time, sending emails, and even launching Visual Studio Code. The assistant interacts through speech and responds to your voice commands.

Here are some of the key features of SHANK:
Wikipedia Search: Simply ask a question, and SHANK will provide a concise summary from Wikipedia.
Website Navigation: Use voice commands to open popular websites like YouTube, Google, and Stack Overflow.
Music Playback: SHANK can play music files from a designated folder on your computer.
Time Announcement: Curious about the time? Just ask, and SHANK will let you know the current time.
Email Sending: You can compose and send emails via Gmail, with voice dictation handling both the message and the recipient.
Application Launching: Open applications like Visual Studio Code directly through voice commands.


#will launch an updated and better version soon
