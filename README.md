# virtual_assistant
This project is a basic implementation of a personal voice assistant called SHANK. It can perform simple tasks like fetching information from Wikipedia, opening websites, playing music, telling the time, sending emails, and even launching Visual Studio Code. The assistant interacts through speech and responds to your voice commands.
